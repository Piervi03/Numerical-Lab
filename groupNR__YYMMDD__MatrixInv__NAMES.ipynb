Note that one can easily obtain the inverse of $\\mathbf{A}$ if $\\vec{b}$ is the identity matrix. In the scipt you have read about the Gaussian elimination algorithm which you are now asked to apply to the system.\n",

    "During the process, you have converted the equation into \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{R} \\vec{x} = \\mathbf{M} \\vec{b}$$ where $\\mathbf{R}$ is a upper triangular matrix. The system can now be solved in an easy and efficient way. Basically you have decomposed the original matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ into two matrices as $$\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{R}$$ where the matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ captures the equivalent transformations you performed during the gaussian elimination algorithm. You have therefore implicitly factorized the original matrix.\n",

Of course triangular matrices are specifically easy to solve and if we could find a decomposition such that $\\mathbf{B}$ is an lower triangular matrix and $\\mathbf{C}$ is an upper triangular matrix, we obtain a highly efficient solution scheme. For each square matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ there exists a permutation matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ and two triangular matrices $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$ of the form defined in (scipt 19) such that $$\\mathbf{P} \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{U}$$ is valid. If $\\mathbf{A}$ is invertible, then the decomposition of $\\mathbf{P}$ is unique. Note that $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{P}^{-1}$.\n",
